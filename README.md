# Ensemble-averaging solver for dilute cavitating bubbly flows

This code was primarily written by Keita Ando around 2011, who was advised by Tim Colonius during his Ph.D. at Caltech.
The code has some changes from Spencer Bryngelson and is primarily used as a development cross-reference at this point.

Some features
* 1D
* MPI enabled
* Tait equation of state
* Different bubble cavitation models
